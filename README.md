ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project is an ETL pipeline built using Apache Airflow to automate the process of extracting raw sales data from a CSV file, transforming it into a clean and structured format, and loading it into a MySQL database. The goal is to make the data ready for analysis and reporting.

The workflow is organized as a daily-scheduled Airflow DAG, with clear modular tasks for Extract, Transform, and Load phases. This setup ensures reusability, scalability, and visibility into every step of the pipeline execution.
